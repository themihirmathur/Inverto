## Implementation

### 1. Data Ingestion
The initial step involves ingesting raw data and preprocessing it to extract relevant information. This data is then tokenized, filtered, and normalized to ensure consistency.

### 2. Index Construction
An inverted index is constructed from the preprocessed data. This involves mapping each term to its corresponding document occurrences, creating a highly efficient data structure for quick lookups.

### 3. Compression
Effective compression techniques are applied to the inverted index to reduce storage requirements and improve query processing speed. Various algorithms are evaluated to determine the most suitable one for the dataset and query patterns.

### 4. Query Processing
The search engine processes user queries by efficiently retrieving relevant documents from the compressed inverted index. Advanced algorithms are employed to rank and return the most relevant results.

### 5. User Interface
The front-end interface, designed using Qt, allows users to interact with the search engine seamlessly. It supports various query types and provides an intuitive way to view and navigate the search results.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for implementing the search engine. Python's extensive libraries and frameworks facilitate complex algorithms and NLP tasks.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing the inverted index, ensuring scalability and fast data retrieval.
- **Qt**: A powerful framework for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) of the search engine, offering a rich user experience.
